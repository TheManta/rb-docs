# Credits

A full list of writers can be found on the project's [contributors page][1].

Special thanks to [nt153133][4] and [Saga][5] for enduring questions on memory (GreyMagic) and execution flow (TreeSharp, Coroutines).  Without their insight, coverage of these topics would be anemic at best.

Shoutouts to [Angles24][14], [Entrax][9], [ExMatt][10], [Fryheit][11], KateTheGreat, [Omninewb][12], [sodimm][13], [y2krazy][8], [zzi][6], and everyone else who has developed add-ons, shared code/tutorials, supported users, or generally made RebornBuddy worth using.

[RebornBuddy][2] is developed by [mastahg][7] and published by Bossland GmbH.
