RebornBuddy itself can be [downloaded here](http://updates.buddyauth.com/getnewest?filter=RebornBuddy64), but has little value without add-ons.

Below is directory of useful downloads from community developers.  Some are paid, others are free.  Projects may also have broken with patches or changed plans -- check support links for latest statuses.

This list may be inaccurate or incomplete.  Feel free to update this list on GitHub, even to add your own projects.
